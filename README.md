Specifics:

- Took inspiration from the squish effect their main button had and applied to my upgrade buttons when hovered via keyframe CSS animation.

benho612 for spinning animations + game layout. <https://github.com/benho612/CMPM1212-D1-Assignement>
Specifics:

- Took inspiration from their game layout and applied it to my game. Used their game-container CSS class to do this. Additionally applied some elements of their game layout to my text elements. Also created a spinning keyframe CSS animation to play when the button was pressed which was also inspired by their button.
